''' Ques 5. Why and when to use while loop in python give a detailed description with example.

Ans. In Python, a while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
It is a pre-test loop, which means that the condition is tested at the beginning of each iteration.
If the condition is true, the loop body will be executed, and then the condition will be tested again.
The loop continues until the condition becomes false.

The syntax of a while loop in Python is as follows :
while condition:
    # code to be executed repeatedly while condition is true

Here, the condition is a Boolean expression that evaluates to True or False. The code block inside the loop is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true.
If the condition becomes false, the loop is exited and the program continues to execute the code that comes after the loop.

Below is an example of a while loop that prints out the numbers 1 to 10 :
'''
count = 1   # initialize a counter variable
while count <= 10 :   # loop condition
    print(count)   # code block
    count = count + 1   # increment the counter variable
print("While loop condition is now False !")

''' In this code, we first initialize a counter variable count to 1. We then use a while loop with the condition count <= 10.
This means that the loop will execute as long as the value of count is less than or equal to 10.
Inside the loop, we print out the value of count, which will be the numbers 1 to 10 in sequence.
We then increment the value of count by 1.
When the value of count becomes 11, the condition count <= 10 becomes False, and the loop is exited.
The program continues to execute the code that comes after the loop.

In summary, the while loop is useful when we need to repeatedly execute a block of code while a certain condition is true. '''

''' Ques 6. Use nested while loop to print 3 different pattern.

Ans. Kindly find below 3 different patterns using nested while loop.
They are named as Pattern 1, Pattern 2 and Pattern 3 respectively. '''

# Pattern 1 :

'''Pattern 1 :

# Pattern 2 :

# # QUESTION : 7

''' Ques 7. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1.

Ans. To display numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop in Python, we can initialize a counter variable to 10 and use a while loop with the condition that the counter variable is greater than 0.
 In each iteration of the loop, we can print the counter variable and decrement it by 1. '''

i = 10                      # initialize the counter variable
while i > 0 :              # loop condition
    print(i)                     # print the counter variable
    i = i - 1                        # decrement the counter variable
